# 3.2.4.2 Example of Statement Editing

With an example of changing the interpolation parameter from P \(joint interpolation\) to L \(linear interpolation\), the following describes how to edit a statement.

1.	Press the &lt;enter&gt; key on the teach pendant while in the statement cursor status. Then, the statement cursor will change to the word cursor status, allowing the P \(joint interpolation\), which is the interpolation parameter of the move statement, to be selected. In the input area, P, which is the current setting value of interpolation, will be displayed and the interpolation parameter that can be inputted will be displayed as buttons on the right side of the screen.
