# 4.3.7.1 Example of Step Copy

You can copy the steps 2–5 of the program 1 to step 2 of the program 2 \(set as the input step\) in the right and reverse directions.

The steps 2–5 of the original program \(program 1\) will be inserted right after the input step \(step 2\) of the target program \(program 2\) in the right direction \(same order as the original program\) or in the reverse direction \(reverse order of the original program\).
