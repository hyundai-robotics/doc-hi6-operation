{% hint style="info" %}
* R361 code cannot be used in automatic mode. It must be used in manual mode.
* The inching distance set using the R361 code will be set for the currently set jog level. Therefore, if the current jog speed level is 8, the inching distance corresponding to 8 will be changed.
* Jog inching is possible only when the jog inching key is activated \(LED On\). 
* The jog inching level setting function is for engineers, so it is not supported for general users. Please contact our engineer for details on this function.
