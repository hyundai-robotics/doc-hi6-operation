# 4.3.4 Recording Coordinate System

You can change the coordinate system of the step position recorded as a hidden pose. You can check the coordinate system you have changed to by pressing the quick open button at the concerned step. During the startup of the robot, the use of the \[4: Transformation of the reference coordinate system\] menu will be restricted.

1.	Touch the \[6: Program Conversion &gt; 4: Transformation of the reference coordinate system\] menu. Then, the recording coordinate system shifting setting window will appear.

2.	After setting the recording coordinate system option, touch the \[OK\] button.

* \[Source program\]/\[Target program\]: You can input the number of the original program \(Initial setting value: The currently selected program\) of which recording coordinate system you want to change and the number of the new program you want to save after the change of recording coordinate system. If you set the number of the target program to match the same number as that of the original program, the original program will be overwritten by and replaced with a new program.
* \[Start Step\]/\[End Step\]: You can set the range of the steps \(Initial setting value: 1/last step\) to which you will apply the change of the recording coordinate system.
* \[Coordinate System Format\]: You can select a coordinate system that you want to designate newly.
