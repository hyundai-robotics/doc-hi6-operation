# 4.3.3 Recording Position

You can change and set the coordinate system of the step position recorded as a hidden pose in a specific step of the program and apply it to the existing program or create a new program.

1.	Touch the \[6: Program Conversion &gt; 3: Record Pose conversion\] menu. Then the recording position conversion setting window will appear.

2.	After setting the recording position option, touch the \[OK\] button.

* \[source program\]/\[Target program\]: You can input the number of the original program \(Initial setting value: The currently selected program\) of which recording position you want to change and the number of the new program you want to save after the change of recording position. If you set the number of the target program to match the same number as that of the original program, the original program will be overwritten by and replaced with a new program.
* \[Start Step\]/\[End Step\]: You can set the range of the steps \(Initial setting value: 1/last step\) to which you will apply the change of the recording position.
* \[Coord. System Format\]: You can select the coordinate system to shift the position data recorded in the step. If you select base, robot, tool, or user, the position data will be converted to Cartesian coordinate values, and if you select joint, the position data will be converted to axis angles.
