# 2.2.2 Operation Speed Adjustment

In automatic operation, the \[Speed Adjustment\] button on the left side of the Hi6 teach pendant screen will display the robot's operation speed \(%\) while the program is being played back. The displayed operation speed is the ratio of the robotâ€™s moving speed to the speed recorded in the step.

{% hint style="info" %}
In manual mode, the \[Speed Adjustment\] button will display the step speed limit, instead of the playback speed \(%\).
{% endhint %}

In automatic mode, you can adjust the operation speed of the robot, without modifying the program, by changing the value of the automatic operation speed ratio in the condition setting. After touching the \[Speed Adjustment\] button on the left side of the Hi6 teach pendant screen, set the option values of the \[2: Step FWD/BWD maximum speed\] and \[6: Playback speed rate\] in the setting window.
