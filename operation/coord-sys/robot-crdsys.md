1.	Turn on the motor in manual mode and hold the enabling switch on the back of the teach pendant.

2.	Select the robot coordinate system by repeatedly touching the \[Crd. Sys\] button on the right side of the Hi6 teach pendant screen. Then, the jog bar will display X, Y, Z, RX, RY, RZ, and additional axes.

3.	Operate the robot with the jog keys. The robot will move as follows.

{% hint style="info" %}
* For details on the robot’s progress direction in relation to the jog keys, refer to “[2.7.1 Jog Keys](jog-key.md).” 
* 
  If you use your right hand, you can easily understand the operation of the robot in the robot coordinate system.

Figure 26 Coordinate System Direction \(Left\) / Rotation Direction \(Right\)

* If you put the progress direction of the right index finger in the X direction of the robot coordinate system, while you stand on the back of the robot, the progress direction of the thumb becomes the Z direction, and the progress direction of the middle finger becomes the Y direction.
* If you put the thumb of the right hand in the direction of the central axis of rotation, the direction of the other folded fingers becomes the + direction of the rotation direction.
