# 2.3.1.6 Stop Condition

When the conditional expression “after until” is satisfied, the robot stops moving and executes the next command \(step or function\).

The value of the conditional expression “after until” can be checked through the return value of the result \(\) function. You can check whether the move operation is terminated by a conditional expression.
