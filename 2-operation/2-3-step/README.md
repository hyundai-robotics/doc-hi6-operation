# 2.3 Step

A step refers to a specific posture \(the position of each axis or the position of the tooltip\) that is to be recorded in the job program and taken by the robot. In other words, a step is one position that the robot will reach through a movement.

The robot performs various functions while moving from one step to another. For movement from one step to another, a movement condition such as a move, which is a movement command, is required.

* It is the basic unit of robot programming. This is a command for the manipulator to move. It consists of minimum information that is necessary for the operation of the robot. 
* Movement conditions: These are the step statement parameters such as robot position, interpolation, speed, accuracy, and tool number.
