* \[Title\]: This is the function name to be displayed on the button.
* \[on-var.\]: This is the name of the signal output variable or of the number type variable. This is the name of the variable whose value will be turned ON \(assign 1\) when the button is turned ON.
* \[off-var.\]: This is the name of the signal output variable or the number type variable. This is the name of the variable whose value will be turned ON \(assign 1\) when the button is turned OFF.
* \[Toggle\]: This helps you perform the setting in a way that the functions registered with the buttons can be activated or deactivated whenever you touch the buttons. If the toggle function is not used, the functions registered with the button will be activated only while the button is being touched.
* \[Permit on Auto Mode\]: This allows the variable value output function even in automatic mode.
* \[Off on Auto Mode\]: This turns off all variable values \(assign 0\) in automatic mode.

You can easily input the signal output variable value using the \[fb\] button and the \[do\] button. For example, input 2.9 and press the <<b>ENTER</b>> key. It will be converted to and displayed as fb2.do9. If you input 9 without decimal point and press the <<b>ENTER</b>> key, it will be converted to do9.
