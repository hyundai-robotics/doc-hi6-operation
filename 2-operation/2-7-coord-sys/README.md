# 2.7 Coordinate System

Coordinates in space are used to determine the direction of the robot’s movement. Hi6 controller has the joint coordinate system, robot coordinate system, user coordinate system, and tool coordinate system.

* Joint coordinate system: You can move the corresponding joint when touching the \[-/+\] button on the right side of the joint name The buttons on the right are for the + direction, and the buttons on the left are for the - direction. For example, when you move the first joint in the joint coordinate system, the &lt;esc&gt; key will be for the + direction, and the &lt;enter&gt; key will be for the – direction. When you move the second joint, the &lt;→&gt; key will be for the + direction, and the &lt;←&gt; key will be for the – direction.



* Robot/User/Tool Coordinate System: The tooltip \(TCP, Tool Center Point\) of the robot can be moved and rotated based on each coordinate system.
