{% hint style="warning" %}
* The axis origin setting affects the accuracy of the robotâ€™s cartesian operation. Change it to the exact value as much as possible.
* 
  If the axis origin setting is changed, the position of the previously created program will be changed. Therefore, the axis origin setting must be executed only at the initial installation stage.

* 
  If the encoder offset setting is changed, the axis origin should be newly set. Therefore, the encoder offset setting must be completed before the setting of the axis origin.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
At the time of the shipping from the factory, the mechanical origin position of each axis is set at the standard value \(0X400000\).
