* \[1: Power Saving Function\]: You can set whether to use the power saving function and set the wait time.

While the power saving function is used, if the robot is in operation stop status while in the auto mode for a long period, such as waiting for startup or waiting for an input signal, the power supply to the motor will be cut off when the wait time has expired, helping save power consumption. When an operation command is inputted in the robot, the power saving function will be automatically deactivated, allowing the power to be supplied to the motor and the robot to operate.



{% hint style="info" %}
Delays may occur in the process of activating/deactivating the power-saving function. When operating while expecting the speed of the robot, you should set the power saving function as disable.
{% endhint %}

* \[2: Path Recovery on Auto Mode\]: You can set the allowable distance and allowable angle for path recovery in automatic mode.

  During path recovery, an error will be detected if the distance and angle exceed the set allowable range. If the allowable distance is set to 1, no path recovery will take place.
