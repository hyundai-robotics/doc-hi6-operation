# 7.3.2.11 Multiple Signals Input

Input signals \(up to 16 signals\) can be created as a group, and data can be acquired through individual signals.

The data is in binary format and will be determined by the input on or off. For example, if di41 and di43 are on and all other signals are off, the data will be 0101 \(5 in decimal\).

1.	Touch the \[2: Control Parameter &gt; 2: Input/Output Signal Setting &gt; 8: Multiple Signal Input\] menu.

2.	Set the name, signals, and strobe of the input signal group.

For example, when a job program configured as the setting in the screen above is executed, the operation will be as follows.

![Figure 55 Example of Job Program Execution](../../../_assets/image%20%28407%29.png)

After starting from S1 toward S2, the robot executes the wait statement. If the wait condition is satisfied before the accuracy of S2 is ok, the robot will move to the path in red. If this is not the case, the robot will wait until the wait condition is satisfied.
