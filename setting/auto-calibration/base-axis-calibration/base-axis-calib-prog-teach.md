# 7.7.4.2 Base Axis Calibration Program Teaching

1.	Make a reference point in space, and then record the first reference point.

2.	Move the base axis more than 200 mm and record the same point as the second step.

3.	While moving 200 mm or more in the same direction as the direction you moved in step 2, record the same point as the third and fourth steps.

{% hint style="warning" %}
* Teach the travel axis calibration program using a tool for which robot calibration \(optimization of the axis origin and tool length\) has been completed.
* 
  When recording a step, record it using a tool number for base axis calibration.

* 
  Record the position by setting the moving distance of the base axis between recording steps as far as possible.
