# 7.4.9.1 Main Functions of the Jog Inching Function

* Inching applicable coordinate systems
  * 
    Inching in the joint coordinate system: Movement will take place as much as the distance \(mm\) and angle \(deg\) designated for each joint.

  * Inching in the Cartesian coordinate system
  * Inching in the tool coordinate system 
  * Inching in the user coordinate system: Movement will take place as much as the amount designated for the X, Y, and Z positions \(mm\) and Rx, Ry, and Rz postures\(deg\).
* Inching level 

  You can set the inching distance at the same level as the existing jog speed, so you can select eight levels of speed, and you can set the inching distance for each level.
