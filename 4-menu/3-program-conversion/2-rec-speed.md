* \[Source program\]/\[Target program\]: You can input the number of the original program \(Initial setting value: The currently selected program\) whose recording speed you want to change and the number of the new program you want to save after the change of recording speed. If you set the number of the target program to match the same number as that of the original program, the original program will be overwritten by and replaced with a new program.
* \[Start Step\]/\[End Step\]: You can set the range of the steps \(Initial setting value: 1/last step\) to which you will apply the change of the recording speed.
* \[Method\]: You can set the method of designating the speed.
  * \[specify Speed\]: You can convert the recorded speeds by batch.
  * \[specify ratio\]: If the unit of the recorded speed and the unit of speed selected in the \[Unit\] option match with each other, the speed can be converted to a ratio against the recorded speed.
  * \[change unit\]: You can convert the unit of the recorded speed.
* \[Range\]: You can set the application section within the range of the steps of which recording speed you want to change.
* \[Unit\]: You can set the unit of speed. When the speed designation method is selected as \[specify ratio\], only those that match the unit of the speed recorded in the step will be converted to the percentage of the ratio.
* \[Speed\]: This will mean the ratio value if you select the \[specify ratio\] as the speed designation method.
