            <br />When a trouble occurs in the robot system, you can check and record the
            contents of the trouble, the time of trouble occurrence, as well as the
            program number, step number, axis data, and input/output status at the
            time of the trouble occurrence, and then manage the log of troubles. This
            makes it possible to analyze the cause of trouble or refer to the log of
            troubles that occurred prior to system recovery.</li>
          <li>[+N]: You can check the log of notifications.</li>

            number, step number, axis data, and input/output status at the time of
            input, will be recorded. When the robot is repaired, you can refer to the
