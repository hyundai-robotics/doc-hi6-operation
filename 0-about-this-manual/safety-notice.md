* The safety equipment to be used after being connected to the controller must be connected to the safety contact terminal or to the configurable digital I/O set, which is to be set as the safety I/O, in double signals. When the equipment is connected to common contact terminals or in a single signal, the regulated safety level cannot be satisfied.
* Do not put your fingers or other body parts behind the controllerâ€™s inner bracket. There is a risk of electric shock or injury.
* 
  If you are a robot application system manufacturer or a robot user, you should fully understand the contents of the manual and complete the product operation training.

* For the safety of workers and users, you must prepare appropriate safety facilities, such as safety fences, before installing the product.
* Check the specification information and perform fastening by using appropriate fixing screws. Loosened screws may lead to separation of the robot, causing it to fall or suffer damage.
* Be careful not to let conductive foreign substances, such as liquid, dust, or metal powder, enter the connection sections \(power and cables\). Moreover, do not poke the connection parts with a pointed object or apply excessive force to them when connecting them. Corrosion or temporary short-circuiting of the connection terminals may cause the product to explode or suffer a fire.
* Check the wiring information and connect the devices using the appropriate terminals corresponding to the type of individual devices. In particular, if a safety device is connected to a general terminal, the safety function cannot be guaranteed, so you must connect it to the terminal designed for safety devices.
* Never use a damaged cable and do not disconnect the power while the product is in use. It may cause electric shock, fire, failure, or injury.
* 
  If the product is used for a long time, it may generate heat and cause injury, such as burns. If you need to touch the product, turn off the power and leave it for at least one hour to let it cool sufficiently before carrying out works.

* 
  Use the teach pendant while paying attention to the movement of the robot.

* If the teach pendant warns of a fatal error, stop the robot with the emergency stop switch immediately, identify the cause, and resolve the error. If the error cannot be resolved, please contact our customer support team for an inquiry.
* Never install, modify, disassemble, or repair the product without our permission. It may cause a failure or an accident. In addition, we are not responsible for any damage to or breaking of the product if you do not follow the instructions.
