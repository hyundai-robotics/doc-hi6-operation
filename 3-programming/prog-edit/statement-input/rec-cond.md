* When position recording is performed, the move statement will be recorded based on the condition set in the recording condition.
* In the mechanism set, you can designate the configuration of the mechanism to be stored when position recording is performed.

If you briefly touch the \[mechsets\] button, the predefined mechanism set numbers will appear in sequence.

If you touch and hold the \[mechsets\] button, you can modify the existing set configuration in the Mechanism Set setting window, or add or delete a mechanism set by using the \[+\] or \[-\] button.
