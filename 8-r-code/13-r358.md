# 8.13 R358 for Changing the Servo Tool

You can manually connect and disconnect the servo tool in the servo tool change system. 

To change the servo tool in the servo tool change system, you need to disconnect or connect the power and various signal lines using a physical automatic tool change \(ATC\) device.

When the servo tool is a servo gun, if you want to manually perform the change work, you need to move the robot, while the motor is turned on, to the servo gun support table where you can connect or disconnect the robot, and then perform the change work. If the servo tool is a different type, such as a positioner, you can perform the change work when the preparation for connection and disconnection work is completed.

R358 servo tool change parameters and the examples are as follows.
