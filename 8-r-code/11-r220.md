# 8.11 R220 for Setting the Panel Thickness \(Sv\)

You can manually set the panel thickness to record the servo gun spot welding step.

If you execute the one-touch recording in which the MOVE and SPOT statements are to be simultaneously recorded while only the servo gun fixed electrode is in the state of being in contact with the panel, the position of the moving electrode will be automatically recorded in the MOVE statement in consideration of the panel thickness and wear volume.
